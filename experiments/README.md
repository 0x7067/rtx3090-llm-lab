# Experiments (not shipped)

These patches are measured but did not meet the ship bar. They are preserved
for the next attempt, not for production use.

- `armG-combined-i64-nthr128-plus-grid.patch` — MMQ small-batch tile and grid
  reconfiguration, env-gated with `GGML_CUDA_MMQ_SMALLN=1`. It cuts the
  verify-path marginal cost from 13.0 to 11.0 ms per cycle and measured +4.4%
  end-to-end decode, below the +10% bar. It passes 1267/1267 MUL_MAT
  correctness cases. Before any ship: run KLD against production, smoke-test
  the other backends (the grid change touches every J≤8 MMQ launch), and gate
  the ffn_down and m≤1024 regressions. `docs/mmq-small-batch-analysis.md` is
  the full analysis.
- `testcov-mulmat-qwen38-verify.patch` — adds the Qwen3.8 speculative-verify
  GEMM shapes to `test-backend-ops`. Upstream has no coverage for them. Apply
  this before benching any MMQ change.
- `testcov-fattn-wide-verify-widths.patch` — FA test cases for verify widths 16–64 at 32k/64k KV depth (D=256, GQA 6, q4_0 KV). This crossover region of a shipped kernel had zero upstream coverage, which is how the inline-path bound went unmeasured for two waves. Apply before benching any FA change.

## vLLM experiments

- [`mtp-suffix-lookup-plan.md`](mtp-suffix-lookup-plan.md) and the
  `mtp-suffix-vllm*` directories contain the rejected MTP plus suffix-lookup
  prototypes from the 2026-08-28 campaign.
- [`gdn-fused-sm86/`](gdn-fused-sm86/) contains the isolated Ampere fused GDN
  kernel. Its operator tests passed, but end-to-end MTP acceptance collapsed.
- [`vllm-pr51812/`](vllm-pr51812/) contains a clean 0.27.1 backport and analysis
  for the speculative GDN gate-indexing fix. It has not been promoted.
